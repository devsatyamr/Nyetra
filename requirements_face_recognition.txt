# Face Recognition Test Requirements
# Basic requirements (always needed)
opencv-python>=4.8.0
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Advanced face recognition (optional, install if you want better accuracy)
# Note: These require additional system dependencies
# dlib>=19.24.0
# face-recognition>=1.3.0

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Basic setup (OpenCV only):
#    pip install opencv-python Pillow
# 
# 2. Advanced setup (with face_recognition):
#    - Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools and CMake first
#    - Then: pip install dlib face-recognition
#
# 3. Alternative for dlib issues:
#    pip install dlib-bin  # Pre-compiled dlib wheel (if available)
